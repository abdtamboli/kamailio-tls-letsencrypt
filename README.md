# kamailio-tls-letsencrypt

Kamailio in docker container with TLS enabled using Let's Encrypt.

---

# The idea and the purpose

The purpose of the code in this project is to provide a simple way to deploy a Kamailio server in a docker container with TLS enabled using Let's Encrypt.

Thanks to Fred Posner's [article](https://www.fredposner.com/1836/kamailio-tls-and-letsencrypt/) I've understud that there are 2 ways to deal with TLS in Kamailio:

*quoting Fred Posner*:

>1. Use a purchased certificate
>    - Pro: easy to deploy on client side
>    - Cons: expensive, painful acquisition model
>1. Use a self-signed certificate
>    - Pro: free
>    - Cons: difficult to deploy on client side

- if you use a **self-signed certificate** (not certified by any authority) on your SIP Server, necessarily on client-side you must use its `calist.pem`; so *free but difficult to deploy on client side*.
If you want to go down this road [here](doc/SELF-SIGNED-CERT.md) you can find my personal guide. You can also find the procedure here [here](https://www.kamailio.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/tls:create-certificates) and [here](https://kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/tls.html) on [Kamailio](https://kamailio.org)'s site):

- if you use a **certificate trusted** by a guarantor authority recognized by the client then client-side should not need to load the `calist.pem`; so *easy to deploy on client side but expensive*.
If you want to go down this road you have to buy a certificate and the put it in you Kamailio installation following the same procedure describe for self-signed certificates.

:warning: There is, however, an **alternative** that is free, automatable, easy to use and requires no client-side configuration: `Letâ€™s Encrypt`.

I wrote this article and created this repository to take a step forward from Fred's excellent article [https://www.fredposner.com/1836/kamailio-tls-and-letsencrypt/](https://www.fredposner.com/1836/kamailio-tls-and-letsencrypt/).
Fred explains how to install Let's Encrypt and create a certificate (using `letsencrypt-auto`, which unfortunately is no longer supported) and how to configure the certificate in kamailio.
I want to go one step further and explain how to have a `recipe` and a ready-to-use `docker-compose` that allows you to:

- pre-configure the TLS certificate for our domain
- pre-configure kamailio to use the certificate
- have a container that checks the validity of the certificate and autonomously performs the renewal when necessary
- have, ready-to-use, an nginx reverse proxy that uses the certificate: `HTTP 80 -> HTTPS`

### Step to deploy

1. clone the repository in your deploy machine
    `git clone https://github.com/tommasinigiovanni/kamailio-tls-letsencrypt .`
1. pre-configure the TLS certificate for our domain
    - [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).
    - Modify configuration of nginx
        Of course change `your.domain.com` with you real domain and change `1.2.3.3` with your real IP address.

        - **Linux users**

            ```bash
            cd modules/nginx/nginx-certbot
            sed -i 's/${DOMAIN}/your.domain.com/g' init-letsencrypt.sh
            sed -i 's/${DOMAIN}/your.domain.com/g' data/nginx/app.conf
            sed -i 's/${IP}/1.2.3.4/g' data/nginx/app.conf
            ```

        - **MacOS users**

            ```bash
            cd modules/nginx/nginx-certbot
            sed -i '' 's/${DOMAIN}/your.domain.com/g' init-letsencrypt.sh
            sed -i '' 's/${DOMAIN}/your.domain.com/g' data/nginx/app.conf
            sed -i '' 's/${IP}/1.2.3.4/g' data/nginx/app.conf
            ```

    - Run the init script and follow the Let's encrypt instructions:
        `./init-letsencrypt.sh`
        :warning: It's quite important to compile correctly the conf in this way; in particolar `Organization Name` and `Common Name` with your domain

1. return in the root of the project and compile the `.env` file following the `env-template` file
    `cd ../../.. && cp env-template .env` and complete the `.env` file

1. start all the containers
    `docker-compose up -d`

### Technical details

1. :warning: this project is designed for **dev** purpose, so it is not optimized for production.
    - `docker-compose` for example use the build stage

        ```bash
        ...
        build:
          context: ./modules/db
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ...
        ```

        so if you want to have a production ready version you can use built image:

        ```bash
        ...
        image: your.registry.com/project-name/db:latest
        ...
        ```

1. :warning: this project is designed to run on a VM to which the domain you configured in `init-letsencrypt.sh` and in the `.env` points and with a correct domain.

    If you run the `init-letsencrypt.sh` on your local private machine and you set `${DOMAIN} = your.domain.com` you'll receive an error like this

    ```bash
    Requesting a certificate for your.domain.com

    Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: webroot). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
    Domain: your.domain.com
    Type:   dns
    Detail: no valid A records found for your.domain.com; no valid AAAA records found for your.domain.com

    Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to download the temporary challenge files created by Certbot. Ensure that the listed domains serve their content from the provided --webroot-path/-w and that files created there can be downloaded from the internet.

    Some challenges have failed.
    Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
    ERROR: 1
    ```

    This happens because Let's Encrypt need to test if you are the admin of the domain.
